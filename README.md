Serialize.NET
=============

A cross-platform library for efficiently serializing objects into a variety of formats.

Features
========

* Simple and effective support for backward compatibility when adding new serialized object members.

* Supports a variety of serialization formats, including JSON, XML, Bencode, and PBON, with a single API.

* Available as a Portable Class Library, so it can be used with Mono, Xamarin.iOS, and Xamarin.Android as a cross-platform solution.

* Supports transmitting objects between platforms (regardless of processor endianness, for example).

* Supports inspection of the underlying byte stream, which enables scenarios such as digital signing.

* Suitable for extending into higher-level abstractions, for example, a messaging protocol.
